# kubernetes_go

A new Flutter project where I have made an app for android and iOS devices:
-> The app is to control a kubernetes service.
-> The user is provided with a simple clean flutter app to perform basic tasks of kubernetes.
-> The user does not need to know CLI commands to interact with kubernetes cluster.
